    \subsection{Cristóbal Kay (2018) Modernization and Dependency Theory. From The Routledge Handbook of Latin American Development Julie Cupples, Marcel Palomino-Schalscha, and Manuel Prieto, eds. New York: Routledge, pp 15-28.}
    \subsubsection{Modernization Theory}
    \noindent \textbf{Historical Context:} Emerged in the North (
1950s-1960s) during the Cold War. Arose post-WWII as decolonization
accelerated.\\

    \noindent \textbf{Core Idea:} Development is a transition from a
`traditional' to a `modern' society. It posits that underdeveloped countries
can `catch up' by replicating the experience of Western, developed countries.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Change is seen as determined by internal factors
    \end{itemize}

    \noindent \textbf{Dualistic Typology:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Traditional Socieites:} Simple, rural subsistence
        economy, family labour, primitive technology, low productivity.
        Characterized by partciularism, adscription, and collective
        orientation. `Traditionalism' itself is seen as a barrier due to
        fatalistic outlook.
        \item \textbf{Modern Societies:} Complex, industrial,
        market-oriented, wage labour, scientific technology, high
        productivity. Characterized by universalism, achievement
        orientation, self-orientation, upward social mobility, and rule of law.
    \end{itemize}

    \noindent \textbf{Key Theorists and Concepts:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Walt W. Rostow (1960):} Proposed five universal stages
        of economic growth:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item [$1$.] The traditional society;
            \item[$2$.] The preconditions for take-off;
            \item[$3$.] \textbf{Take-off (the key turning point)};
            \item[$4$.] The drive to maturity;
            \item[$5$.] The age of mass-consumption.
        \end{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Samuel Huntington (1968):} Priotized
        \textbf{political order and stability} above other modernization
        goals, concerned that rapid social change could overwhelm political
        institutions. Critiqued mainstream MT for being too static, arguing
        all societies combine traditional and modern elements.
        \item \textbf{Other theorisits focused on:} Value changes (Moore),
        personality transformation (Lerner), psychological factors like the
        desire to achieve (McClelland), and entreprenurial spirit (Hagen).
    \end{itemize}

    \noindent \textbf{Modernization Theory in Latin America:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Largely absorbed uncritically by Latin American social
        scientists and policymakers.
        \item \textbf{Gino Germani (1981):} A notable exception who adapted
        MT. He argued that transition processes create conflicts and
        `asynchronies' as different social spehres change at different
        speeds. However, his work was criticized from a Marxist perspective
        for failing to address class and ethnic conflicts.
    \end{itemize}

    \noindent \textbf{Critique of Modernization Theory (by Andre Gunder Frank):}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Empirically faulty and theoretically weak.
        \item \textbf{Main flaw:} Assumes underdevelopment is an original
        state and ignores how development and underdevelopment are part of a
        single process in the formation of the world capitalist system since
        the 15th century.
        \item Fails to account for the impact of colonialism and imperialism.
    \end{itemize}

    \subsubsection{Dependence Theory (DT)}
    \noindent \textbf{Historical Context:} Arose in Latin America in the
mid-1960s, challenging MT. Influenced by theories of imperialism and the
Latin American structuralist school (ECLAC).\\

    \noindent \textbf{Core Idea:} Underdevelopment is not an original state
but a \textbf{`conditioning situation'} where the economies of some
countries (the periphery) are conditioned by the development and expansion
of others (the center).
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Development and underdevelopment are seen as two faces of the
same historical process of global capitalism.
        \item It analyzes the link between external (global capitalism) and
        internal (class structure, politics) factors.
    \end{itemize}

    \noindent \textbf{Precursor: Raul Prebisch and ECLAC Structuralism:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Developed the \textbf{center-periphery paradigm}.
        \item \textbf{Prebisch-Singer Thesis:} Argued the international
        trade system benefits the center at the expense of the periphery due
        to the long-term deterioration of the periphery's terms of trade (
        prices of its primary commodity exports fall relative to the
        industrial goods it imports).
    \end{itemize}

    \noindent \textbf{Main Strands of Dependence Theory:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item [$1$.] \textbf{Structuralis Strand:} Seeks to reform the
        capitalist system. Uses heterodox development theory concepts.
        \item[$2$.] \textbf{Marxist Strand:} Argues dependency can only be
        overcome by overthrowing capitalism adn transitioning to socialism.
        Relies on historical materialism and the labour theory of value.
    \end{itemize}

    \noindent \textbf{Key Structuralist Theorists and Concepts:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Osvaldo Sunkel:} Focused on how transnational
        corporations (TNCs) deepen dependece and cause
        \textbf{`national disintegration'}. TNCs weaken the national
        bourgeoisie, fragment society, and shape public policy against the
        national interst.
        \item \textbf{Celso Furtado:} Analyzed
        \textbf{`dependent consumption patterns'}. The consumption habits of
        the rich, influenced by developed countries, create a wasteful,
        capital-intensive, and import-demanding industrial structure that
        perpetuates income concentration and underdevelopment.
        \item \textbf{Fernando Henrique Cardoso and Enzo Faletto:}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Emphasized analyzing \textbf{`situations of dependency'}
            rather than a single theory, focusing on internal manifestations.
            \item Characterized the process as
            \textbf{`dependent development'}, rejecting stagnationist views
            and acknowledging that economic growth could occur within a
            dependency framework.
            \item Argued a \textbf{`new dependency'} emerged under
            corporatist-authoritarian states controlled by a militarized
            technocratic bureaucracy.
        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}

    \noindent \textbf{Key Marxist Theories and Concepts:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Theotonio Dos Santos:} Identified a
        \textbf{`new character of dependency'} rooted in industrial and
        technological dependence. The lack of a domestic capital goods
        industry and indigenous technological capacity prevents dependent
        economies form being `articulated' and achieving autonomous development.
        \item \textbf{Ruy Mauro Marini:} Focused on \textbf{unequal exchange} (transfer of surplus value to dominate countries) and the resulting \textbf{over-exploitation of labour} in dependent countries to maintain profit rates. Also developed the concept of \textbf{sub-imperialism}, where a larger dependent country like Brazil under its military regime could engage in imperialist practices toward weaker neighbours to solve its own problems of insufficient internal demand.
        \item \textbf{Andre Gunder Frank:} Coined the phrase
        \textbf{``the development of underdevelopment}. Argued that the
        metropolis-satellite linkages constantly recreate underdevelopment.
        Contended that Latin America has been capitalist since the colonial
        conquest, challenging the prevailing feudal/semi-feudal
        characterization and the political strategies based on it. His
        thesis was famously critiqued by Ernesto Laclau for overemphasizing
        market circulation while neglecting relations of production.
    \end{itemize}

    \noindent \textbf{Decline and Legacy of Dependence Theory:} It's
influence waned with the economic crisis of the 1980s and the rise of
neoliberalism. Remebered as the
\textbf{first major challenge to the Eurocentric character of the social sciences} to achieve global influence. It inspired a new generation of scholars to think about development from the perspective of the South.

\subsection{Laura Zapata-Cantu and Fernando González (2021) Challenges for Innovation and
Sustainable Development in Latin America: The Significance of Institutions and
Human Capital. Sustainability.}

    \subsubsection{Innovation and Sustainable Development in Latin America: Core Challenges}

    \noindent \textbf{Context:} Sustainable development is a critical 21st
century challenge, compounded by the COVID-19 pandemic which has shifted
government and business priorities. Innovation is essential for
transitioning to a more sustainable world.\\

    \noindent \textbf{Regional Challenges:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{High social inequality and poverty} remain significant
        obstacles.
        \item The region has a history of
        \textbf{political instability and corruption}, which impacts
        institutional performance in innovation and sustainability.
        \item Economies are vulnerable to \textbf{commodity price volatility} and uncertainty.
        \item There is a \textbf{marginal contribution to global innovation}, often measured by patent registrations.
        \item Latin American countries face ongoing issues with nutrition,
        sanitation, quality education, and economic modernization.
    \end{itemize}

    \subsubsection{Theoretical Framework for Analysis}

    \noindent Two key theoretical perspectives are used to analyze
innovation and sustainable development in the region:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item [$1$.] \textbf{Dynamic Capabilities (DCV):} A framework
        focusing on a
        country's or firm's ability to adapt and transform in response to a
        changing environemnt. It is composed of three core capabilities:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Sensing:} Identifying opportunities and threats by
            scanning markets and technologies. THis aligns with the Global
            Innovation Index (GII) dimensions of \textit{Institutions} and \textit{Market Sophistication}.
            \item \textbf{Seizing:} Mobilizing resources to capture
            opportunities by investing in technology, human capital, and new
            business models. This aligns with the GII dimensions of
            \textit{Human capital and research, Infrastructure, and Business sophistication}.
            \item \textbf{Transforming:} Continuously reconfiguring assets
            and organizational structures to maintain the competitiveness.
            This aligns with the GII dimensions of
            \textit{Knowledge and technology outputs and creative outputs}.
        \end{itemize}
        \item[$2$.] \textbf{Mission-Oriented Policies:} Systemic public
        sector initiatives aimed at solving specific societal problems (
        e.g., climate change) by mobilizing innovation across multiple
        sectors and actors.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item These policies define a clear direction, foster
            collaboration between public and private sectors, and drive
            technological and systemic change.
            \item They require strong institutional support and the
            development of dynamic capabilities within government to lead
            change.
        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}

    \subsubsection{Analysis of Latin America's Performance}

    \noindent \textbf{Innovation (Based on Global Innovation Index 2020):}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Overall Performance:} The region contributes
        marginally to global innovation. The analysis covered 15 countries.
        \item \textbf{Performance by Dynamic Capability:}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Sensing (Weak):} The
            \textbf{institutions dimension received the lowest average score}, indicating issues with the political, regulatory, and business environment. Countries with better overall GII scores (e.g., Chile) performed better in this dimension.
            \item \textbf{Seizing (Mixed):} The
            \textbf{Business Sophistication dimension had the best average score}. However, many countries show a deficit in human capital development and RnD investment, despite having knowledge workers.
            \item \textbf{Transforming (Partial Success):} Some countries
            like Costa Rica and Mexico perform relatively well in
            transforming capabilities (creative and knowledge outputs) but
            lag in sensing and seizing, suggesting innovation occurs without
            fully considering environmental changes.
        \end{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Key Deficits:} To improve innovation, Latin America
        needs to strengthen institutions, increase investment in RnD,
        develop human capital.
    \end{itemize}

    \noindent
\textbf{Sustainable Development (Based on Sustainable Development Report 2020):}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Overall Performance:} Most Latin American countries
        rank in the middle portion globally. Chile, Costa Rica, Uruguay, and
        Ecuador are in the top 50 of 166 countries.
        \item \textbf{Regional Priorities (Highest-Ranked SDGs):}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item SDG 1 (No Poverty);
            \item SDG 4 (Quality Education);
            \item SDG 13 (Climate Action)
        \end{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Significant Challenges (Lowest-Ranked SDGs):}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{SDG 9 (Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure)}
            was the lowest-ranked goal in 10 countries.
            \item \textbf{SDG 10 (Reduced Inequality)} was the lowest-ranked
            in eight countries, indicating it is not a key priority for most
            governments in the region.
        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}

    \subsubsection{Proposed Roadmap and Policy Implications}\

    \noindent \textbf{Integrated Approach:} Effective strategy requires a
systemic approach that aligns strong
\textbf{institutions, mission-oriented policies, dynamic capabilities, and innovation}.\\

    \noindent \textbf{Role of Institutions:} Strong, inclusive institutions
are crucial for setting the direction through mission-oriented policies that
coordinate public and private actors. Weak institutions make it difficult to
address critical problems.\\

    \noindent \textbf{Role of Government (Public Sector):}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Government should not just fix market failures but actively \textbf{co-create markets and ecosystems}.
        \item The public sector must take a leading role in translating
        societal challenges into concrete missions. This requires compotent
        public agencies and dynamic capabilities within the state.
    \end{itemize}

    \noindent \textbf{Human Capital:} Substantial investment in education
and human resource development is essential to build the skills required for
innovation.\\

    \noindent \textbf{Policy Focus:} Policies must encourage a shift from a
risk-management approach to one focused on seizing opportunities for
sustainable innovation.

    \subsection{Eduardo Gudynas (2013) Debates on Development and its Alternatives in Latin America: A Brief Heterodox Guide, in Beyond Development: Alternative Visions from Latin America, M. Lang and D. Mokrani, eds. Quito: Fundación Rosa Luxemburg, pp.15-39.}
    \subsubsection{The Conventional Concept of Development}

    \noindent \textbf{Definition and Origins:} Development is conventionally
understood as economic and social progress, often tied to growth,
modernization, and higher standards of living. Its modern usage in social
sciences solidified after World War II, establishing a division between
`developed' and `underdeveloped' nations.\\

    \noindent \textbf{Core Ideas (Mid-20th Century):}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Development becasue almost synonymous with economic growth.
        \item It was viewed as a \textbf{linear process} where
        `underdeveloped' countries should emulate Western nations, as
        described in Rostow's stages of growth.
        \item Indicators like Gross Domestic Product (GDP) became primary
        targets.
        \item This model legitimized resources exploitation and the
        destruction of cultures and the environment in the name of progress.
    \end{itemize}

    \subsubsection{Early Critiques and `Development Alternatives'}

    \noindent These critiques question the \textit{methods} of devlopment
but often accept its core goal of material progress.\\

    \noindent \textbf{Dependence Theory (1960s-1970s):}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Challenged the linear view, arguing that
        \textbf{underdevelopment is a consequence of development}, not a
        prior stage.
        \item Ascribed this condition to colonialism, imperialism, and
        asymmetrical power relations between the industrial `centre' and the
        resource-exporting `periphery'.
        \item While critical, this school still prioritized
        industrialization and economic growth.
    \end{itemize}

    \noindent \textbf{Ecological Limits to Growth (1970s):}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item The 1972 Club of Rome report, \textit{The Limits to Growth},
        argued that \textbf{perpetual economic growth is impossible} on a
        finite planet.
        \item This reporth was widely attacked, including by some Latin
        American intellectuals who saw it as a threat to modernization adn
        the use of the region's resources.
        \item A Latin American response,
        \textit{Catastropher or New Society? (1975)} argued problems were
        sociopolitical, not physical, and proposed a socialist model but
        still defended economic growth, albeit regulated.
    \end{itemize}

    \noindent \textbf{Human-Centered Approaches:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Sought to separate development from purely economic growth and
        focus on social dimensions.
        \item Key concepts include:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Another development:} Emphasized meeting basic
            needs, self-reliance, and endogeneity (defined within each society).
            \item \textbf{Human scale development (Max Neef):} Focused on
            people, not objects, and addressed poverty as a plural concept
            of unmet needs.
        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}

    \noindent \textbf{Sustainable Development:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Initially (1980), it meant using renewable resources without
        exceeding their renewal rates to meet human needs.
        \item The WCED's `Our Common Future' (1988) report offered a widely
        cited by polysemic definition that ultimately
        \textbf{reconciled sustainability with economic growth}, turning
        opposites into mutually dependent concepts.
        \item This was criticized for being a `contradiction in terms' as
        ``nothing physical can grow indefinitely''.
    \end{itemize}

    \subsubsection{The Ideology of Progress and the Post-Development Critique}

    \noindent This school of though critiques the foundational
\textit{ideas} behind development itself.\\

    \noindent \textbf{Development as Ideology:} The persistence of
development, despite its failures, suggests it functions as an
\textbf{ideology} -- the contemporary expression of the ideology of
\textbf{progress}. This ideology is shared across conventional liberal,
conservative, and socialist thought.\\

    \noindent \textbf{Post-Development:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item A post-structuralist approach that deconstructs development
        as a \textbf{discourse} that shapes thought, institutions, and
        practices.
        \item It does not seek `another development' but rather examines its
        ecological foundations.
    \end{itemize}

    \noindent \textbf{Critique of Modernity:} Questioning development
requires questioning the project of \textbf{Modernity}, which is rooted in:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item A universalizing model based on European culture;
        \item A linear concept of history as progress from `backwardness';
        \item A sharp \textbf{duality separating society from Nature}, with
        Nature being an object for human use.
    \end{itemize}

    \noindent \textbf{Coloniality of Power:} Modernity was introduced to
Latin America via colonialism, imposing certain ideas about society,
knowledge, and history while excluding others (e.g., indigenous knowledge
systems).

    \subsubsection{Alternatives to Development}

    \noindent These frameworks seek to move beyond the ideology of progress
and the assumptions of Modernity.\\

    \noindent \textbf{Core Concepts:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item They are \textbf{post-capitalist and post-socialist}, breaking
        with the shared ideology of progress.
        \item They challenge the society/Nature duality, often incorporating
        biocentric ethics (recognizing Nature's intrinsic view) and
        relational ontologies.
        \item They prioritize \textbf{well-being in a broad sense},
        including collective, spiritual, and ecological dimensions, over
        material accumulation.
        \item They require intercultural exchange and the inclusion of other
        knowledge systems, especially indigenous ones.
    \end{itemize}

    \noindent \textbf{Buen Vivir (`Good Living'):}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item An example of alterantive to development, drawing heavily on
        Andean indigenous knowledge (e.g., \texit{sumal kawasy, suma qamana}) as well as critical Western traditions like biocentrism and feminism.
        \item It breaks with anthropocentrism and linear progress to focus
        on community well-being in harmony with Nature.
        \item It can be understood as a political platform for building
        social orders free from the constraints of modernity.
    \end{itemize}

    \subsubsection{Contemporary Context: Progressive Governments and Neoextractivism}

    \noindent Since the late 1990s, many Latin American `progressive'
governments have rejected neoliberalism. However, in practice, they largely
adhere to a conventional development model based on
\textbf{economic growth, investment and exports}.\\

    \noindent This has led to \textbf{progressive neoextractivism}: the
intensive exploitation of natural resources (mining, oil), to fund social
programs. This model perpetuates environmental and social harm, denies
ecological limits, and reproduces core tenents of development myth
identified by Furtado decades ago.
